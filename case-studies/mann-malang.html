                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>Mann Malang is a non-profit community for people with intersex variation to provide resources and
                        foster connections.</p>
                    <h4>The Objective</h4>
                    <p>To create a <abbr title="Progressive Web App">PWA</abbr> to help users (that are intersex people
                        or connected to intersex people) have access to resources that can provide them with help and
                        necessary information. The goal is to also let the users connect with like minded people and
                        build a community.</p>
                    <h4>My Role:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User personas based on the client's research</li>
                        <li>User flow mapping</li>
                        <li>Creating the wireframes</li>
                        <li>Creating the final designs</li>
                        <li>Curating the illustrations</li>
                        <li>Making the logo</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The Problem</h4>
                    <p>People from the Intersex community often find it hard to find help or resources or even people
                        who may be facing the same challenges as them in the world. Even caretakers (such as parents,
                        siblings, etc.) of intersex people need access to helpful resources and to other people in
                        similar situations as themselves.</p>
                    <h4>The Solution</h4>
                    <p>To create a platform which can offer resources, insights and a place to foster community and
                        rewarding relationships.
                        This community would be for people that identify as intersex as well as people that are
                        connected to them.</p>
                    <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To create a safe space.</li>
                        <li>To keep anonymity at the forefront.</li>
                        <li>To seamlessly bring together multimedia blogs, webinars, listicles, forums and chat spaces
                            together.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>My Process</h4>
                    <p>The client came to me already having an idea of what they wanted to create, which was a <abbr
                            title="Progressive Web App">PWA</abbr>. This would be beneficial in India as it was a
                        product that had to reach as many people as possible and the primary device to access the
                        internet in India is a smartphone<sup>1, 2</sup>. A desktop version of the PWA would also be
                        created for the minority who have access to desktops/laptops.</p>
                    <p>This cemented our decision to follow a mobile first design strategy.<sup>3, 4</sup></p>
                    <p>Having worked with communities on the ground with their target audience, they already had a bank
                        of research on the users. It was my job to bring their ideas to life.</p>
                    <h5>User Personas</h5>
                    <p>The first step was to sift through the user data that was collected by the clients and understand
                        the frustrations and motivations of the users.</p>
                    <p>I aggregated the vast data and created 5 personas, consisting of people with intersex variation,
                        caretakers of intersex people and researchers/activists.</p>
                    <img class="image-case-studies" src="../images/projects/mann-malang/malang-2.png" alt="malang-2">
                    <h5>User Flows</h5>
                    <p>After creating the user personas, a very thorough site map and user flow was made.</p>
                    <p>The client already had a clear idea of what functionalities they wanted to include in the
                        product. These functionalities included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Article pages, including image and video</li>
                        <li>Blogs & listicles</li>
                        <li>Webinars</li>
                        <li>Forums & threads</li>
                        <li>Connecting with other users</li>
                        <li>Messaging</li>
                        <li>Profile</li>
                        <li>Dashboard and curated feed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After listing out the functionalities a site map was created to figure out a clear navigation for
                        the user. The challenge was to keep the navigation as simple as possible, considering how many
                        different sections were there in the product. The product was split into two main sections, what
                        you could see when signed in and when signed out. The idea being that even if someone didnâ€™t
                        want to interact with the community, they would still have access to helpful information from
                        blogs, articles, webinars and videos.</p>

                            src="https://whimsical.com/embed/Q1Q3MeU2Epm5bJ2k7yYj2d"></iframe>
                    <p>Based on the site map, the user flow was created.</p>
                    <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border:none;"

                    <h5>Wireframe</h5>
                    <p>A high fidelity wireframe was created showing every screen in detail. A mobile only wireframe was
                        created as this was a <abbr title="Progressive Web App">PWA</abbr>. Once the wireframe was
                        approved by the client, the final UI design was created for mobile and desktop as well.</p>
                    <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border:none;"
                            src="https://whimsical.com/embed/P6RCoEqYiZ4ArrQzqdipNq"></iframe>
                    <h5>Final Design</h5>
                    <p>During my research I came across a few other websites related to the intersex community. I
                        observed that most of them primarily use the intersex colours<sup>5</sup> (yellow and purple)
                        and they were very text and information heavy.</p>
                    <p>The final design for this project also used the intersex colours, but in a different way. I used
                        different shades of yellow and purple that would complement each other rather than assault.</p>
                    <p>The design finally created was based on one scenario of the type of content that would be
                        uploaded. For example, there was a certain template created for blog thumbnails, forum
                        thumbnails, etc. How the website would finally be displayed to the user would be based on the
                        actual content uploaded from the backend by the client and the feed that each individual user
                        would see according to their interests.</p>
