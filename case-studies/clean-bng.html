                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>Jhatkaa is an organisation that empowers citizens to take action with the help of various
                        campaigns.
                        Namma Clean Bengaluru is one such initiative to tackle the problem of garbage dumping and
                        burning by increasing citizen involvement
                        in tandem with the relevant authorities.</p>
                    <h4>The Objective</h4>
                    <p>To create a website where users can report garbage dumping and burning and also form squads to
                        have clean up events.</p>
                    <h4>My Role:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make User Personas based on client's research</li>
                        <li>User Flow Mapping</li>
                        <li>Create Wireframes</li>
                        <li>Create Final Designs</li>
                        <li>Create Illustrations</li>
                        <li>Make a Logo</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The Problem</h4>
                    <p>Bengaluru has suffered from the problem of garbage dumping and burning for years which has also
                        given it the nickname of ‚ÄúGarbage City‚Äù at times.
                        Citizens litter anywhere and the municipality is not always able to clean it up.</p>
                    <h4>The Solution</h4>
                    <p>To create a platform which enables citizens to be more involved in the cleanliness of their city.
                        Citizens would be able to report sightings of garbage, form squads to keep their wards clean and
                        have clean up events. This would also help the relevant authorities to locate and clean up
                        garbage more efficiently.</p>
                    <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To make the process of reporting easy and rewarding.</li>
                        <li>To keep the users continually engaged with the platform over time.</li>
                        <li>Create a <abbr title="Progressive Web App">PWA</abbr> to show the multitude of information
                            concentrated on a phone.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>My Process</h4>
                    <p>The clients came to me with a very good idea of what they wanted to build. Having worked with
                        communities on the ground with their target audience, they already had a bank of research on the
                        users. It was my job to take their idea and turn it into an end product.</p>
                    <h5>User Personas</h5>
                    <p>The first step was to sift through the user data that was collected by the clients and understand
                        the frustrations and motivations of the users. I aggregated the vast data and created 2
                        personas, Raj and Jaya, representing the average users.</p>
                    <p>The users already have a certain level of involvement in clean ups around the city. They are
                        dissatisfied with the level of cleanliness in their neighbourhoods and want to work with the
                        authorities to make their areas better.</p>
                    <p>The users understand the individuals‚Äô social responsibility about waste segregation at source and
                        how the authorities‚Äô struggle with cleaning the areas when individuals do not do their due
                        diligence.</p>
                    <img class="image-case-studies" src="../images/projects/clean-bng/clean-bng-2.png" alt="post-thumb">
                    <h5>User Flow</h5>
                    <p>After creating the user personas, a very thorough user flow was made.</p>
                    <p>The client already had a clear idea of what they wanted the product to function like. They wanted
                        a map as the base with everything else working around it.</p>
                    <p>The functionalities that were shortlisted for the <abbr title="Minimal Viable Product">MVP</abbr>:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Garbage dumping reporting</li>
                        <li>Garbage burning reporting</li>
                        <li>Clean up reporting</li>
                        <li>Squad joining</li>
                        <li>Event joining</li>
                        <li>Profile levels & Badges</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The <abbr title="Minimal Viable Product">MVP</abbr> with its shortlisted functionalities is live and working. It was decided to rely on WhatsApp for communication between users, squads and authorities as WhatsApp is used as the de facto messaging service in India.<sup>1, 2</sup></p>
                    <p>This not only made the product much cheaper to develop and maintain, but it also makes it easier
                        for people to reach out to their own contacts and new users.</P>
                    <p>A strategy used in the platform to keep user engagement up was taken from Nir Eyal‚Äôs book
                        ‚ÄòHooked‚Äô. Hooked by Nir Eyal is a book that explains how tech companies get people to use their products repeatedly. User habits are explained by the Hook Model which consists of four looping cycles: trigger, action, variable reward, and investment.<sup>3</sup></p>

                            src="https://whimsical.com/embed/9EqsUzgHipvAYp2dJLShxu"></iframe>
                    <h5>Wireframe</h5>
                    <p>Mobile phones being the primary access to the internet for the vast majority of the users in India<sup>3</sup> was the deciding factor to develop a <abbr title="Progressive Web App">PWA</abbr> first and foremost.</p>
                    <p>A high fidelity wireframe was created based on the user flow shown above.</p>
                    <p>A mobile first design strategy<sup>4, 5</sup> was used for the product and was designed to be scaled easily into a full scale desktop website later.</p>
                    <p>Keeping the map as the base in mind, all the other functionality was placed on top of the map.
                        The first thing the user would see on top would be the location search bar and the map filters
                        (garbage, clean-ups, events and squads). The <abbr title="Call to action">CTA</abbr>s were kept at the bottom of the screen to have
                        the quickest and easiest accessibility.</p>
                    <p><i>Only a few wireframe screens have been shown below.</i></p>
                    <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border:none;"
                            src="https://whimsical.com/embed/MFXqPTy7G2pHqQBFsdL1QG"></iframe>
                    <h5>Final Design</h5>
                    <p>Several factors were taken into consideration to create the final designs such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Emotions that we wanted to invoke in the users</li>
                        <li>Colours to use for desired impact</li>
                        <li>The tone of the language used</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The emotions that we wanted to invoke in the users were action, responsibility, community
                        participation and joy.</p>
                    <p>The colours that we primarily decided to use were Jhatkaa‚Äôs brand colours of red,white and grey
                        as they also serve the purpose of invoking the feelings of action & urgency in this product.</p>
                    <p>Feelings of joy and community participation would be brought about by usage of illustrations in
                        key places. Motivational and rewarding tools such as profile badges would also increase joy and
                        user engagement and participation.</p>
                    <p>The language used throughout the product is friendly and rewarding, making sure to reward the user after they have invested in the cause.</p>

                    <h5>Icons</h5>
                    <p>Various types of icons were created for this project.
                        An icon for the project itself was also created symbolising a community coming together to clean
                        up Bengaluru.</p>
                    <p>Map Icons: These icons were made to be used on the map to depict specific filters.</p>
                    <img class="image-case-studies" src="../images/projects/clean-bng/clean-bng-5.png" alt="post-thumb">
                    <p>Profile Icons: These icons were made for the different profile levels. It is a motivational means to increase user engagement. As the user keeps earning more badges, their profile grows from a seed to a full bloom.</p>
                    <img class="image-case-studies" src="../images/projects/clean-bng/clean-bng-6.png" alt="post-thumb">
                    <p>Badges: A set of 21 badges were created as a motivational method to increase user engagement in all four fields of reporting garbage, checking clean-ups, joining events and squads.</p>

                    <h5>Onboarding</h5>
                    <p>A set of 4 minimal animations were created, in lottie format, for the onboarding process.</p>
