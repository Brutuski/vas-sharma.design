                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>TDC is a mass image gathering app for a car manufacturer, developed by my client Xane AI. These
                        images create a database to train an <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence"
                                                                   class="initialism">AI</abbr><sup>1</sup> used in
                        another app, for the same car
                        manufacturer.</p>
                    <h4>The Objective</h4>
                    <p>To help users upload thousands of images of various car models, variants and specific parts in an
                        organised manner.</p>
                    <h4>My Role:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User Research</li>
                        <li>User Flow Mapping</li>
                        <li>Creating Wireframes</li>
                        <li>Creating the Final Designs</li>
                        <li>Creating the Illustrations</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The Problem</h4>
                    <p>The car manufacturer required an app that would enable their customers to be able to self
                        diagnose any problems with their car using <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence"
                                                                         class="initialism">AI</abbr>. That app would be
                        able to take a picture, recognise the part, diagnose the problem and show possible solutions to
                        the customer.</p>
                    <p>To make the above described app, no current AI model or the dataset existed.</p>
                    <h4>The Solution</h4>
                    <p>In order to have a self diagnosing app, the <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence"
                                                                         class="initialism">AI</abbr> (developed by Xane
                        AI) would first have to be trained with thousands of images of every car part according to the
                        car models and various variants.</p>
                    <P>This is where TDC comes in. TDC would enable the employees of the car manufacturer to click and
                        upload images required to train the <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence"
                                                                  class="initialism">AI</abbr> model.</p>
                    <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                    <p>The major challenge was to develop an app that could be easily used by employees of the car
                        manufacturer across a country as vast and culturally diverse as India. The secondary challenge
                        was to make the method of mapping pictures to various cars (and their parts) easy and error
                        free. The app had to be very easy to navigate through in order to get accurate data to train
                        the <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence" class="initialism">AI</abbr> model.</p>
                    <h4>My Process</h4>
                    <h5>The User</h5>
                    <p>The typical user of this product is an employee of the car manufacturer, one that works in a
                        repair/service stations and in the factory.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Is in the 20s age group</li>
                        <li>Not highly educated</li>
                        <li>An assembly line employee or a mechanic</li>
                        <li>Knows the ins and outs of the vehicles</li>
                        <li>Has basic understanding of English</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>An educated assumption was made that the target user is also familiar with WhatsApp<sup>2</sup>
                        and Facebook<sup>3</sup> due to their prolific usage amongst smartphone users in India. Thus
                        ensuring that the user has enough understanding of navigating within an app.</p>
                    <p>The challenge of the app would be to make it easy enough for the user to navigate to get accurate
                        data to train the AI model, as fast as possible.</p>
                    <h5>User flows</h5>
                    <p>The first step was to map out the journey of the user and to keep the number of steps, required
                        to achieve the goal, as low as possible.</p>
                    <p>I sat with the client to understand the steps that had to be taken to reach the end goal, which
                        essentially was to click and upload pictures of different parts of the car. In order to make the
                        users achieve the goal that was required, we had to make the process linear<sup>4</sup> and
                        airtight.</p>
                    <p>Since TDC is intended only for the selected employees of the car manufacturer, there was no
                        need for a sign-up process. The manufacturer loads the app onto the employeeâ€™s work phones as
                        required. Sign in is done via phone number and a SMS based OTP verification.</p>
                    <p>The journey begins with signing in. Signing in for the very first time shows the user 3
                        onboarding screens. Every subsequent sign in leads the user directly onto the main screen of the
                        app.</p>
                    <p>Once signed in, the user selects a car model, then the model variant and then finally selects the
                        feature name after which they can either click pictures from the inbuilt camera or upload
                        pictures clicked earlier.</p>
                    <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border:none;"
                            src="https://whimsical.com/embed/Gj5zjmHYSYpRsyH82YMmKy"></iframe>
                    <h5>Wireframes</h5>
                    <!--          TODO Fix Arrows for onboarding in the image-->
                    <p>The high fidelity wireframe was built based on the user flow above. The process and screens were
                        designed in a very simple and linear manner. There is a quick access navigation bar at the
                        bottom with the <i>menu</i>, <i>home</i> and <i>activity log</i> options. There are also simple
                        yet clear breadcrumbs at the top which shows the user, exactly which step/screen they are on.
                    </p>
                    <p>The menu only needed to have two options, <i>Contact Us</i> and <i>Logout</i>, which is why I
                        decided to make it a bottom overlay menu. On tapping the menu icon, the menu slides out from the
                        bottom, keeping the two options close to the thumb for easier one-handed accessibility.</p>
                    <p>Illustrations are used in a few places such as in onboarding and sign in to add a visual element
                        which helps in understanding the features of the app. Images have been used in the "Select
                        Model" screen to help users quickly and visually identify the car.</p>

                            src="https://whimsical.com/embed/TkrDs1iaRg91ExvyzVcDNe"></iframe>
                    <h5>Final Designs</h5>
                    <p>The app was intended only for Android based devices and was designed based on
                        <a class="btn btn-tertiary" style="padding: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0"
                           href="https://m2.material.io"
                           target="_blank">Material Design 2 Guidelines</a>.</p>
                    <p>The app uses a very simple colour scheme, keeping the focus entirely on the core aspects of the
                        app. The colours used follow
                        <a class="btn btn-tertiary" style="padding: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0"
                           href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/"
                           target="_blank">WCAG Guidelines</a> maintaining contrast ratios to maintain visual
                        accessibility.</p>

                    <h4>Illustrations</h4>
                    <!--                    TODO Add illustrations-->
                    <p>A set of 4 illustrations were created for the "Sign In" screens. </p>
                    <p>Another set of 3 illustrations were created for onboarding new users. The illustrations created
                        are direct & minimal to communicate the message in a simple manner to the users.</p>
